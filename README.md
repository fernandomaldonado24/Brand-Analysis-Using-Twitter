# Brand-Analysis-Using-Twitter
Social network and sentiment analysis of Adidas and Lululemon Twitter activity using Python, with influencer detection and topic modeling via LDA.

## Project Overview:
This project presents a data-driven analysis of brand engagement and public sentiment surrounding Adidas and Lululemon on Twitter. Using a combination of social network analysis, topic modeling, and sentiment analysis, the project explores how users interact with each brand, identifies key influencers, and uncovers the dominant themes and emotional tone of online discussions.

A directed graph approach is used to model user interactions, with centrality metrics such as in-degree, betweenness, and closeness employed to detect structurally important users. A custom Influencer Score was developed to highlight potential micro-influencers based on authentic engagement and network position.

Complementing the network analysis, advanced natural language processing techniques were used to clean, lemmatize, and analyze the text content of tweets. Topic modeling via Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) identified key themes per brand, while VADER sentiment analysis measured public sentiment at both general and topic levels.

The findings reveal contrasting brand narratives:

Adidas is linked with athletic culture, product launches, and digital innovation.

Lululemon is associated with wellness, sustainability, and community values.

The project further recommends suitable micro-influencers for each brand, aligning with their network prominence and thematic resonance. These insights support the development of targeted influencer marketing and content strategies, grounded in real user behavior and sentiment.
